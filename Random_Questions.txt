Q : What is recursion in Python?
A : Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
    A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other.
    Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

    Recursion is a method of programming or coding a problem, in which a function calls itself one or more times in its body.     Usually, it is returning the return value of this function call.
    If a function definition satisfies the condition of recursion, we call this function a recursive function.
