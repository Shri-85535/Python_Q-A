Q : What is recursion in Python?
A : Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
    A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other.
    Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

    Recursion is a method of programming or coding a problem, in which a function calls itself one or more times in its body.     Usually, it is returning the return value of this function call.
    If a function definition satisfies the condition of recursion, we call this function a recursive function.

Q : In Python 3, the maximum value for an integer is 2^63 - 1?
A : False, In Python 2, there was an internal limit to how large an integer value could be. But that limit was removed in         Python 3.
    This means there is no explicitly defined limit, but the amount of available address space forms a practical limit             depending on the machine Python runs on.
